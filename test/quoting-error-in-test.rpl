-- no issue was filed for this bug.
-- an invalid escaped character like \' used to throw a lua exception in the cli code.

foo = "\abc"

-- test foo accepts "\abc"     -- this should pass. note that \a is a valid escape.
-- test foo accepts "\x07bc"   -- this should pass. note that the \a is \x07

-- test foo accepts "\'abc", "\abc"  -- first one fails with invalid escape sequence
-- test foo includes bar "\?abc"     -- fail with invalid escape sequence
