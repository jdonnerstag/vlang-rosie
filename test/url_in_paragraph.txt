Reference: https://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls

The referenced blog post claims that the url that should be extracted from the
line numbered 1 below will end in a single closing parenthesis because the last
closing parenthesis is part of the surrounding test.  Similarly, line 3 has a
url ending with 'h' because the period is the end of the sentence.

However, it is perfectly legal for a url to end in two closing parentheses, or
in a period.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to extract the desired urls in these two cases,
which lack the final ')' or '.' respectively, if you believe that the input is
unstructured.  It can be done if you are willing to assert that any use of
parentheses outside of a url will be balanced, and that all sentences have
recognizable terminating punctuation.

If these assertions are in fact true, then the input text is actually
semi-structured, and the approach taking on the 'daringfireball' blog is both
correct and useful.  But users of the regex solution posted there must be aware
that when these assertions are not true, the solution will fail.

The RPL pattern 'net.url_common' will extract a url from line 1 below that ends
with two closing parentheses.  And one from line 3 that ends in a period.  RPL
users can write alternatives to use instead of 'url_common' that account for
balanced parentheses and sentence punctuation.  (The latter is particularly
challenging, unless you take the shortcut suggested on the 'daringfireball'
blog, which is simply to not allow a url to end in a period.)

Another issue is UTF-8 encoded characters that are outside of the ASCII range.
URI encoding is defined in terms of the ASCII character set, and the UTF-8
encodings of non-ASCII characters must be
percent-encoded. (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987) Therefore, the url on
line 7 below is invalid.  Its prefix, up to but not including the unicode
character, is a valid url.

1 (Something like http://foo.com/blah_blah_(wikipedia))
2 A url with parentheses: http://foo.com/blah_(wikipedia)#cite-1
3 Period ends this sentence: http://foo.com/blah_blah.

And some more urls that contain parens are:

4 http://foo.com/more_(than)_one_(parens)
5 http://foo.com/blah_(wikipedia)#cite-1
6 http://foo.com/blah_(wikipedia)_blah#cite-1
7 http://foo.com/unicode_(âœª)_in_parens
8 http://foo.com/(something)?after=parens

In this document, there are 10 urls: 8 are numbered, and 2 are within the
explanatory text.
